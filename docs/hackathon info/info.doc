About Circle
Circle is a leading innovator in digital currency infrastructure. As issuer of USDC, a trusted and widely used stablecoin, Circle is dedicated to enabling seamless, scalable value exchange globally.


The launch of Arc, an open EVM-compatible Layer‑1 blockchain, marks a new milestone. It is purpose-built for stablecoin-native finance, featuring USDC as its native gas, predictable dollar-denominated fees, sub-second settlement, institutional-grade FX, privacy controls, and deep integration with Circle’s ecosystem.

Participants in the USDC x Arc Hackathon will build on this robust financial infrastructure — championing programmable money for the next generation of digital finance.


Build intelligent, real-world payment systems where AI drives decisions and Arc executes them with USDC

Your mission: Build an AI-powered payment solution on Arc using USDC. Projects must deliver working prototypes within these innovation tracks:


🔁 On-chain Actions – Create AI agents that autonomously interact with DeFi protocols like swaps, lending, or liquidity rebalancing.

🏢 Payments for Real-World Assets (RWA) – Enable recurring or conditional USDC payments for tokenized assets like real estate, treasuries, or supply chain settlements.

📺 Payments for Content – Design AI-native payment flows for creators, including micropayments, tipping, or subscription models for generative content.


Submissions should include:


• A working prototype

• Clear problem-solving purpose

• Clean, maintainable code

• Simple, usable interfaces

• Realistic pathways for adoption or reuse

Technology & Access
To build your project on Arc, you'll use a combination of recommended providers for account abstraction and onchain utility.

🔒 Required Technologies:
• Arc - All transactions settle on Arc, an EVM-compatible Layer-1.
• USDC - USDC is the native EVM asset on Arc and is used for gas fees, transfers, and smart contract interactions.




⚙️ Account Abstraction (Smart Wallets & User Onboarding):
Tools that simplify wallet creation, authentication, and onboarding for users.
• Circle Wallets - Create in-app wallets for global users and facilitate commerce at enterprise scale.

• Para - One wallet for your ecosystem - identity, assets, and onboarding that only happens once.



🧩 Onchain Utility (Cross-Chain Tools & USDC Movement):

Protocols and SDKs that let you move USDC and interact with multiple chains.



• CCTP V2 (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol) - Seamlessly transfer USDC across supported blockchains for cross-chain agent use cases.
• Bridge Kit - The Bridge Kit SDK lets you move USDC across blockchains in only a few lines of code.
• Gateway - Circle Gateway enables a unified USDC balance, unlocking on-demand liquidity and redefining crosschain UX.
